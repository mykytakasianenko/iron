1. Init project
2. Follow auth tutorial from [Supabase auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-expo-react-native)
3. Link to your project by following this [instructions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/overview)
4. Add migrations copy "User Management Starter" and add own migrations
```sql
create table profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users on delete cascade not null primary key,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone,
  username text unique,
  full_name text,
  avatar_url text,
  website text,

  constraint username_length check (char_length(username) >= 3)
);

alter table profiles
  enable row level security;

create policy "Public profiles are viewable by everyone." on profiles
  for select using (true);

create policy "Users can insert their own profile." on profiles
  for insert with check ((select auth.uid()) = id);

create policy "Users can update own profile." on profiles
  for update using ((select auth.uid()) = id);

create function public.handle_new_user()
returns trigger

  values (new.id, new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', new.raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url');
  return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql security definer;
create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();

insert into storage.buckets (id, name)
  values ('avatars', 'avatars');

with check ((auth.uid() = user_id));
```
4. Create functions using `supabase functions new <name>`, more you can read [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/quickstart)
5. Copy code from `supabase/functions` in this project
6. Push migrations and functions by running `supabase db push` and `supabase functions deploy`
7. Create state using zustand, create `state/workouts`, `state/chat', `state/profile' and copy code from corresponding files from repository
8. In the supabase ui, go to integrstions and enable [pg_cron, and pg_net](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cron)
9. Select daily-workout-count
10. Create files `hooks/useWorkoutExport.ts` and `components/ExportWorkoutsButton.tsx` and copy corresponding files
